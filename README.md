## Election-Audit Summary
  In my opinion, this script is very efficient and multi-faceted. With a few modifications, it can be used for any election. One being changing the variables to find the counties with the lowest turnout, rather than the largest to help determine which areas they need to be better with campaigning in. Another change is adding demographics to your analysis to determine who their target market is and who they need to attempt to improve their relationship with in order to increase their vote percentage.
